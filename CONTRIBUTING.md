# How to contribute to Serverless-Offline

To install all the locked versions for serverless-offline

```bash
npm ci
```

# Development setup

You can test your local changes to serverless-offline if different ways

- Point your **serverless.yml** directly to the local changes
  - agnostic to your tech stack, as long as you have serverless.yml
- Point your npm **package.json** to the local changes
  - depends on an npm project

we are using Babel to transform ES6 modules (static imports and dynamic imports).

## serverless.yml

you have several options:

1. point your `serverless.yml` plugin entry point to `src/main.js`
   (https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/blob/master/src/main.js) and
   uncomment the block between `use strict` and `module.exports`. that way,
   babel/register will compile es6 module syntax on the fly.

   (as an alternative you can point the entry point to the package.json of the
   plugin and change `main` to `src/main.js`)

   ```yaml
   service: foo

   plugins:
     - ../../../src/main.js
     # - ../../../  alternative: point to package.json

   provider:
     memorySize: 128
     name: aws
     # ....
   ```

2. run the build step ahead of running the plugin. in that case don't uncomment
   anything in `main.js`!
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   point your `serverless.yml` plugin entry to the build folder: `./dist/main.js`
   (see 1. on how to)

## package.json

1. Make sure you install/build your local serverless-offline
   ```bash
   # serverless-offline
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```
2. Install the local serverless-offline in your other npm project as a dev dependency
   ```bash
   # in your-npm-project
   npm i -D serverless-offline@file:../serverless-offline
   ```
   After this, you should see a devDependencies like the following in your package.json
   ```JSON
   {
     "devDependencies": {
       "serverless-offline": "file:serverless-offline"
     }
   }
   ```
3. When you make changes to serverless-offline, re-run the build so Babel will
   re-compile the plugin source
   ```bash
   # serverless-offline
   npm run build
   ```
   The local file include in your-npm-project should have the linked changes in
   it's respective node_modules

# Code Style

We're using Prettier, ESlint and the Airbnb preset. To fix errors which are automatically fixable, run:

```
npm run format
```

To run the linter, run:

```
npm run lint
```

# Testing

There are a few test scripts, depending on what type of testing you want to run.

**Unit tests**

To run unit tests only:

```
npm run test:unit
```

**Watch mode**

To run all tests in watch mode (this skips `npm install`):

```
npm run test:watch
```

**Test coverage**

```
npm run test:cov
```
